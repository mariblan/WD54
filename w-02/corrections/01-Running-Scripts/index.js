//Now that you have Node.js installed, let’s run a simple program using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). You can use any of the exercises you’ve worked on or create a new JavaScript file with some code. Follow these steps:

// 1. Create or Select a JavaScript File
// 1.1. You can either download one of the exercises you’ve already worked on or create a new file.
// 1.2. For a new file, open your text editor and write some simple JavaScript code. For example, create a file named hello.js with the following content:
// console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
// 1.2.1. Open the Directory with Visual Studio Code

// 2. Open your terminal (Command Prompt for Windows, Terminal for macOS/Linux).
// 2.1. Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is located. For example, if your file is in a folder named projects, you would type:
// cd path/to/your/projects
// 2.2. Once you are in the correct directory, open Visual Studio Code by typing:
// code.
// 2. This command will open VS Code in the current directory only if you’ve enabled this feature.

// 3. Run the JavaScript File in VS Code
// 3.1. In Visual Studio Code, open the built-in terminal by going to View > Terminal or by pressing Ctrl+J (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+J (macOS).
// 3.2. Make sure the terminal is in the correct directory where your file is located. If not, navigate to the directory using the cd command.
// 3.2. Run your JavaScript file with Node.js by typing:
// node name_of_your_file.js
// 3.4 Replace name_of_your_file.js with the actual name of your file. For example:
// node hello.js

// 4. See the Output
// 4.1. If your script contains code that writes to the console, you will see the output in the VS Code terminal. For example, running the hello.js file should display: Hello, Node.js
// 4.2. Note: You will only see output if your code includes statements that write to the console, like console.log().

// 5. Experiment with More Files
// 5.1. Try running all the exercises you have completed in this manner.
// 5.2. Experiment by creating new scripts and running them with Node.js. For example, create a file named sum.js with the following content:
// a. let a = 5; let b = 10;
// b. console.log("The sum is:", a + b);
// 5.3. Navigate to the directory where sum.js is located in VS Code and run it:
// node sum.js
// 5.4. You should see the output: The sum is: 15
