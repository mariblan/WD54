// PART I
// 1. Global and Function Scope with var:
// 1.1. Declare a global variable using var and log it.
// 1.2. Inside a function, declare another var variable with the same name but different value and log it within the function.
// 1.3. Call your function.
// 1.4. Log your global variable. Did it change? No! This is function scope!

// 2. Block Scope with let and const:
// 2.1.nside a block (use an if statement with a condition of true), declare variables using let and const. Try redeclaring them within the same block to observe errors.
// 2.2. Try to log them inside and outside the if statement. What happens?

// 3. Redeclaration with var:
// 3.1. Try to redeclare your original global variable with var within the if block, log it in and outside the statement. What happens?

// 4. Usage of const for Arrays and Objects:
// 4.1. Declare an array and an object using const. Modify the contents of both and log their values before and after the changes.
// 4.2. constis suggested for arrays and objects declaration since it's only the contents that change but not the reference!

// DISCUSSION:
// 1. Discuss why var might lead to unexpected results when used in blocks.
// 2. Explain why let and const are generally safer to use for controlling scope.
// 3. Consider the mutability of arrays and objects declared with const.
