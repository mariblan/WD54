// Strict vs Simple Equality and Inequality
console.log('5 == "5": ', 5 == '5'); // Simple Equality, should be true
console.log('5 === "5": ', 5 === '5'); // Strict Equality, should be false

// 1. Task Overview:
// 1.1. Use the following values for comparisons: 5, '5', 10, '10', true, false.
// 1.2. Perform comparisons using both simple and strict equality and inequality operators.
// 1.3. Compare values to determine if they are greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to each other.


// 2. Specific Tasks:
// 2.1. Compare 5 and '5' using simple and strict equality.
// 2.2. Compare 10 and '10' using simple and strict inequality.
// 2.3. Check if 5 is greater than 3 and if '5' is greater than '3'.
// 2.4. Evaluate whether 10 is less than 20 and if '10' is less than '20'.
// 2.5. Determine if 5 is greater than or equal to 5 and if '5' is greater than or equal to 5.
// 2.6. Assess whether 10 is less than or equal to 20 and if '10' is less than or equal to '20'.

// 3. Output:
// 3.1. Print each result to the console with a descriptive message, so you know which comparison is being displayed.
